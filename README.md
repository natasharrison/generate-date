# Generate-Date You + Me

## Description

Dinner date web application that randomly generates a dinner recipe and a cocktail recipe suggestion to help take the decision-making out of date night.

## User Story

AS AN Indecisive Adult
I WANT to easily figure out date/dinner plans by having ideas randomly generated for me
SO THAT I can spend more quality time enjoying the date rather than trying to make a decision

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a randomly generated date night
WHEN I hit a generate button
THEN I am presented with a randomly generated recipe and photo along with a randomly generated cocktail recipe and photo
WHEN I click on the save button
THEN the randomly generated date is added to my favorites  
WHEN I click on the date in my favorites
THEN I am again presented with the dinner recipe and the cocktail recipe
